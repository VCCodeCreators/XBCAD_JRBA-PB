# Code Creators Project - Joint River Basin Authorities School Project

## Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of modern education, collaborative and practical projects have become indispensable components of the learning experience. We are a group of five known as "Code Creators," tasked with working together to develop an innovative app. Our endeavor not only serves as a demonstration of our knowledge but also underscores our commitment to addressing real-world challenges, all within the context of Module XBCAD.

## Project Overview

For this project, we've chosen to collaborate with the Joint River Basin Authorities, a significant operational organization within the Ministry of Natural Resources and Energy. Established under section 79 of the Eswatini Water Act of 2003, Joint RBAS â€“ PB plays a pivotal role in strengthening the five River Basins Authorities in Eswatini. Their mission is to enhance water management activities at a sub-national level, extending their reach across the entire country.

## Project Goals

The heart of our project revolves around developing an application that will assist the Joint River Basin Authorities in their essential work. This app will be designed to aid them in calculating water resources efficiently, a task that carries immense significance in a region like Eswatini, where water is a precious and limited resource. By collaborating with this vital organization, we aim to contribute to their mission while gaining valuable experience in the process.

## About the Code Creators

Our school project, undertaken as the "Code Creators" group for the Module XBCAD, is not just a class assignment; it's an opportunity to make a tangible impact by providing technology-driven solutions to a real-world issue. As we embark on this journey, we are excited to learn, collaborate, and innovate, striving to create an app that will benefit both the Joint River Basin Authorities and the community they serve. This project exemplifies the fusion of academic rigor with practical application, reinforcing our commitment to developing skills that extend beyond the classroom.

## Get Involved

Together, we are dedicated to the success of this venture, and we look forward to sharing our journey as we endeavor to build an app that will revolutionize water resource management in Eswatini.
